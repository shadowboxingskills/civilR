# CivilR

This is an initiative to start consolidating civil engineering calculation methods.<br>
The field is obviously broad and this repository only scratches the surface of what could be put together, collectively.<br>
The ambition here is to provide a starting point - focusing specifically on struts mesh design for excavations.<br>
Let's start sharing more and stop reinventing the wheel everytime a new project starts.<br>
Your source code contributions are very welcome!
